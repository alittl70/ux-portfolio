        <p>
            This project was developed as a part of my ITIS 3135 coursework and focused
            on building a multi-page personal website using core web technologies. 
            This site includes structured HTML, basic CSS styling, internal navigation,
            and deployment using GitHub Pages. 
        </p>

        <h4>Skills & Tools Used</h4>
        <ul> 
            <li>HTML5 semantic structure</li>
            <li>CSS styling and layout fundamentals</li>
            <li>Multi-page navigation</li>
            <li>GitHub Pages deployment</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>What I learned</h4>
        <p>
            Although I am still in the process of completing this project, so far it has 
            strengthed my understanding of front-end structure, file organization, and how
            users navigate between pages. It also established a foundation for later coursework
            focused on usability, accessability, and user-centered design.

        <h3> Personal Website - Foundational Web Design Project</h3>

        <p class="project-meta">
            <strong>Course:</strong> ITSC 1110 - Introduction to Computer Science <br>
            <strong>Role:</strong> Designer & Developer <br>
            <strong>Timeline:</strong>January - May 2024
        </p>

        <p>
            This project was my first independently designed and developed website, created 
            as a part of ITSC 1110. The goal was to apply foundaitonal HTML and CSS concepts
            while creating a clear, welcoming landing page that introduced content in a 
            simple and visually engaging way. 
        </p>

        </figure>

        <h4>Focus Areas</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Establishing visual hierarchy using headings and spacing.</li>
            <li>Designing a simple, approachable landing experience.</li>
            <li>Using color intentionally to create a cohesive visual identity.</li>
            <li>Structuring content with semantic HTML elements.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4> What I learned</h4>
        <p>
            While visually simple, this project marked my first experience translating ideas
            into a digital interface. It introduced me to the importance of hierarchy,
            spacing, and clarity in guiding users through content.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, this project highlights how my approach to design has evolved.
            I now prioritize accessability, user-centered decision-making, and iterative
            refinement-principles that guide my current work in UX/UI design and front-end development.
